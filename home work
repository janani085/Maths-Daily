 √20 ,  √65, √27, √101, √50, √166, √98, √77, √57, √89 . They are Non-terminating and Non-recurring decimal numbers
 
 yes
 Irrational Numbers : Eg  √20
 574123 : it is an odd number, yes it is prime number.
 For eg: 2   (2x1=2 , 1x2=2) Prime Number. Eg 9  (1x9=9 ,3x3=9,9x1=9) this is not a prime number.
 
 Imaginary Number
 A complex number is a number that can be expressed in the form a+bi,Where a and b are real numbers, and i is a solution of satisfies their equation,i is called an imaginary number(for eg : 2+3i)
 zero is an even number, it is not a prime number.
